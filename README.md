Welcome to the demo repoistory of an example workflow of MLflow integrated into the FiftyOne App!

The demo consists of two main parts: 
1. The `mlflow_fiftyone_workflow.ipynb` notebook. It will guide you through an example workflow of training with YOLOv9 using FiftyOne, Ultralytics, and MLflow!

2. [The FiftyOne + MLflow plugin](https://github.com/voxel51/fiftyone_mlflow_plugin), a FiftyOne plugin that brings MLflow UI in the app as a panel, as well as track experiments and runs across your FiftyOne datasets as seen below!
