We will demonstate each step of the process, including loading in our training dataset, covering how to curate your data, training and monitoring our model, and performing post training evaluation. The notebook will demonstrate how MLflow and FiftyOne can be paired to level up any training workflow through precise model monitoring and data curation. Paired with FiftyOne's app all this information can be easily digested and explored to increase the peformance of a machine learning engineer.\n",
